## About

`core-js` project provides (as [`core-js-compat`](/packages/core-js-compat) package) all required data about the necessity of `core-js` modules, entry points, and tools for work with it - it's useful for integration with tools like `babel` or `swc`. If you wanna help, you could take a look at the related section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-update-core-js-compat-data). The visualization of compatibility data and the browser tests runner is available below
